### Overview

MetaBridge is a decentralized platform designed to reform the way entrepreneurs and investors collaborate. By leveraging the power of the Starknet blockchain, MetaBridge creates a secure, transparent, and milestone-driven funding ecosystem. Entrepreneurs can create funding orders for their projects while investors gain access to vetted, tokenized investment opportunities. The platform fosters accountability and trust through blockchain-enabled governance and AI-powered support, ensuring measurable outcomes and successful collaborations.

**1. Next.js Framework**: Optimized for speed and SEO, delivering a dynamic and responsive user interface.
**2. StarknetScaffold**: Bootstrap for creating a starkent dapp faster, comes with prebuilt components and starknet provider configurations.
**3. Milestone-Based Funding**
MetaBridge ensures funds are released incrementally based on pre-defined milestones. This milestone-based funding mechanism fosters accountability, allowing investors to vote on and approve each stage before releasing the next tranche of funds.

**4. Tokenized Equity Representation**
Investors’ contributions are represented as blockchain tokens, providing a seamless and transparent way to track ownership and enabling secondary market opportunities for tokenized equity shares.
